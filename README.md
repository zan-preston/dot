# A Flake-based Home Manager Config

Heavily ~~stolen~~ inspired by [ereslibre's](https://github.com/ereslibre/dotfiles/tree/b7b657cd802ba3ba138c3d05b23bdf02802924d9) dotfiles repo

## 2024-06-24 Rework

I reworked this matching the style mentioned above due to wanting to more easily extend my config between machines. I looked at a few examples, some of which used flake-parts, but in the end, I decided this was the simplest path for me to understand, maintain, and extend going forward.
